## Running the Application

### Development Mode
```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```
Access at: http://localhost:5000

### Production Mode
```bash
pnpm run build
pnpm start
```

### Current Deployment
The application is currently running at:
**https://3456-ijye9911xvaeg69jpgy3i-3c133947.manusvm.computer**

## Key Algorithms Implemented

### 1. Gann Angles Calculation
```typescript
// Calculate price levels based on time and angle ratios
const calculateGannAngles = (pivotPrice, pivotDate, targetDate, angle) => {
  const timeDiff = daysBetween(pivotDate, targetDate);
  const priceChange = timeDiff * angle;
  return pivotPrice + priceChange;
}
```

### 2. Square of Nine
```typescript
// Spiral grid based on square root relationships
const generateSquareOfNine = (centerValue, gridSize) => {
  // Start from center and spiral outward
  // Each cell represents a degree of rotation
  // Cardinal and diagonal lines are key price levels
}
```

### 3. Time Cycles
```typescript
// Calculate future dates based on cycle lengths
const calculateCycleDates = (startDate, cycleLengths) => {
  return cycleLengths.map(days => addDays(startDate, days));
}
```

### 4. Lunar Phase Calculation
```typescript
// Simplified lunar phase based on known new moon
const getLunarPhase = (date) => {
  const knownNewMoon = new Date('2000-01-06T18:14:00Z');
  const lunarCycle = 29.530588853; // days
  const age = (date - knownNewMoon) % lunarCycle;
  const illumination = (1 - Math.cos((age / lunarCycle) * 2 * Math.PI)) / 2;
  // Determine phase name based on age
}
```

## W.D. Gann's Trading Philosophy

William Delbert Gann developed his trading methods based on several core principles:

1. **Geometry**: Markets move in geometric patterns and angles
2. **Mathematics**: Square roots and mathematical relationships govern price movements
3. **Time**: Time is more important than price; markets move in cycles
4. **Astronomy**: Planetary movements influence market behavior
5. **Ancient Knowledge**: Sacred geometry and ancient mathematical principles

## Trading with the Platform

### Step 1: Market Analysis
Start with the Market Data page to view current prices and trends.

### Step 2: Identify Pivot Points
Use historical charts to identify significant highs and lows.

### Step 3: Calculate Gann Angles
Enter pivot points into the Gann Angles calculator to find support and resistance levels.

### Step 4: Use Square of Nine
Calculate price targets using the Square of Nine based on current price.

### Step 5: Check Time Cycles
Identify potential turning points using time cycle analysis.

### Step 6: Astrological Confirmation
Check lunar phases and planetary aspects for additional confirmation.
